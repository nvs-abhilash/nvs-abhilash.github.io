Hi! I’m a Machine Learning Engineer II at Amazon One, specializing in Agentic AI, LLM orchestration, and Computer Vision. I architect and deploy scalable multi-agent systems on AWS (Bedrock/Strands) and build deep learning pipelines that solve real-world problems at scale.

Outside of work, I stay curious. I explore emerging tech, contribute to open source, and help organize community events like BangPypers and PyData meetups. I enjoy sharing what I learn, whether through code, talks, or writing.

Lately, I’ve been geeking out on CUDA, AI system design, and Rust—just trying to level up and have fun while doing it.

Thanks for dropping by!
