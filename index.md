Hi! I’m a Machine Learning Engineer at Amazon One Research, where I work on building scalable, efficient models for computer vision problems. My focus areas include deep learning, metric learning, and model optimization—and I love combining ML with solid engineering to solve real-world challenges.

Outside of work, I stay curious. I explore emerging tech, contribute to open source, and help organize community events like BangPypers and PyData meetups. I enjoy sharing what I learn, whether through code, talks, or writing.

Lately, I’ve been geeking out on CUDA, AI system design, and Rust—just trying to level up and have fun while doing it.

Thanks for dropping by!
