**Who am I?**
Hey there! I am Abhilash. A Machine Learning Engineer with more than 5 years of work experience in training and deploying deep learning models. I also have expertise in designing and buidling serverless architectures in AWS.

**What do I do?**
Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Amazone One, where my goal is to take ML code from research to production and build scalable offline systems.

Further, I have always enjoyed giving back to the community. I have contributed to open source projects like GNU Octave, Torchvision, and FastAI.
